- fast compilation times
	- currently there is either too many imported dependencies or complex type/function definitions which cause compilation times to take long
	- namespace out separate domains of functionality, attain ease of use via new `Pipe`
- good balance between type safety and dynamism
	- `[]String | []string | A[String] | A[string]` should be usable interchangeably
		- reflection based `Into[T]` for such type manipulation
	- `Result[T] | Option[T]` should be usable interchangeably
		- `Either.Auto`, `Either.Pass`, `Either.Fail` go a long way
- reflection based `Pipe` to lessen reliance on custom types and methods
	- overloaded array function `Coax` to infer desired action based on input function type
- remove large amount of functions and methods, replacing them with reflection, overloaded, or inferred functionality
	- explore possibilities with removing dependence on custom types altogether
