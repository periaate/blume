Currently blume is between 3 different stages:
- Native Go semantics
	- `fsio/*`
	- `blume.go`
- Custom semantics via custom types
	- `exec.go`
	- `type String string`
- Full custom semantics via reflection
	- `n2.go`
	- some `Either` related functions and methods

Version 1.0 release will be used to make blume work as a true DSL.
The following features will be primary:
- function overloading
	- construction phase will determine functionality based on input/output types
- custom type system
	- type pattern matching
	- types as values
